    <p>    Anime has always been a favorite of mine since there are all types of genres to fit any age.
        The genres can range from action, mystery, sci-fi to romance and slice of life. I primarily enjoy
        anime that is categorized as Isekai (a person in another world), action, adventure, and slice of life.
