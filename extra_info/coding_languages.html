    <h1>My Coding History</h1>
    <p>Due to my time at Saddleback College, I have experience coding in
        C++, C, Assembly, and Java. In C++, I had a project called Serendipity
        which is a bookstore's cash register. In Java, I created a Tic Tac Toe
        GUI which was able to keep track of a leaderboard, user info, and have a
        challenging AI.
